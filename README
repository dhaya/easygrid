# easygrid

A template project using gridgain and clojure.

Install gridgain on all nodes on the grid. Copy clojure.jar and clojure-contrib.jar into
GRIDGAIN_HOME/libs/ext/. The rest of the application clojure code need not be
copied into the individual gridgain instances and can be picked up gridgains's P2P classloading.

Kick of the jobs with 
$lein run easygrid.launcher start
